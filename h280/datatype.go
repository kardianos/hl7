It is not recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA)- Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)- Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. Likewise- entries like department of motor vehicles (DMV) and licensing boards are not recommended for inclusion because the combination of state and identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1.

//
// The HL7 Standard strongly recommends that all systems routinely send the time zone offset but does not require it. All HL7
// systems are required to accept the time zone offset, but its implementation is application specific. For many applications
// the time of interest is the local time of the sender. For example, an application in the Eastern Standard Time zone receiving
// notification of an admission that takes place at 11:00 PM in San Francisco on December 11 would prefer to treat the admission
// as having occurred on December 11 rather than advancing the date to December 12.

// Note: The time zone [+/-ZZZZ], when used, is restricted to legally-defined time zones and is represented in HHMM format.
//
// One exception to this rule would be a clinical system that processed patient data collected in a clinic and a nearby hospital
// that happens to be in a different time zone. Such applications may choose to convert the data to a common representation.

// Hierarchic Designator
//
// The basic definition of the HD is that it identifies an (administrative or system or application or other) entity that has
// responsibility for managing or assigning a defined set of instance identifiers (such as placer or filler number, patient
// identifiers, provider identifiers, etc.). This entity could be a particular health care application such as a registration
// system that assigns patient identifiers, a governmental entity such as a licensing authority that assigns professional
// identifiers or drivers’ license numbers, or a facility where such identifiers are assigned.
//
// The HD is designed to be a more powerful and more general replacement for the application identifier of HL7 versions 2.1
// and 2.2. It adds two additional components, the <universal ID> and the <universal ID type> to the former application ID
// (which is renamed more generically to be the namespace ID).
//
// In the case where an HD identifies an entity that assigns/creates instance identifiers such as a particular patient registration
// system, it defines an "assigning authority". In the case where an HD identifies a location where instance identifiers
// are given out (although they may be created by another entity at another location) such as a particular "department of motor
// vehicles office location," it defines an "assigning facility". These two different uses of the HD appear in many of the
// extended data types.
//
// The "assigning authority" defined by the HD is similar in its role to the coding system (and version) part of the coded element
// data types: both identify a set of more discrete instance identifiers. The difference is that the set of HD-defined discrete
// instances contain identifiers of "real-world" things such as patient or clinical orders, while the coded element-defined
// set of discrete instances contains concept identifiers (codes).
//
// The HD is designed to be used either as a local identifier (with only the <namespace ID> valued) or a publicly-assigned identifier,
// a UID (<universal ID> and <universal ID type> both valued). Syntactically, the HD is a group of two identifiers: a local
// identifier defined by the first component and a universal identifier defined by the second and third components. HDs that
// have defined third components (defined UID types) must have a second component that is unique within the series of IDs defined
// by that component.
//
// Note: The HD is used in fields that in earlier versions of HL7 used the IS data type. Thus, a single component HD (only the first
// component valued) will look like a simple IS data type for older systems expecting a single component in the place of the
// HD data type.
//
// If the first component for the HD data type is present, the second and third components are optional. If the third component
// is present, then the second must also be present (although in this case the first is optional). The second and third components
// must either both be valued (both non-null), or both be not valued (both null).
// This means that if all three components of the HD are valued, the entity identified by the first component is the same as the
// entity identified by components two and three taken together. However, implementers may choose, by site agreement, to
// specify that if all three components of the HD are valued, the first component defines a member in the set defined by the second
// and third components.
//
// Examples:
// Example 1: ISO example with only the 2nd and 3rd components valued:
// |^2.16.840.1.113883.19^ISO|
// The syntax of the second component is defined by the ISO standard for object identifiers, not by HL7 (for which the second
// component is of the ST data type). Thus the periods (".") in the second component are part of the ISO syntax, and are legal
// by the definition of the HL7 ST data type.
//
// Example 2: A UUID example
// |^478A0114-EBF0-7701-A023-6841FF05731A^UUID|
//
// Example 3: A DNS example

// types of linkages (e.g., toxicology). This important information, together with the information in OBR-29 - Parent,
// uniquely identifies the parent result’s OBX segment related to this order. The value of this OBX segment in the parent result
// is the organism or chemical species about which this battery reports. For example, if the current battery is an antimicrobial
// susceptibility, the parent results identified OBX contains a result that identifies the organism on which the susceptibility
// was run. This indirect linkage is preferred because the name of the organism in the parent result may undergo several preliminary
// values prior to finalization.
//
// We emphasize that this field does not take the entire result field from the parent. It is meant only for the text name of the
// organism or chemical subspecies identified. This field is included only to provide a method for linking back to the parent
// result for those systems that could not generate unambiguous Observation IDs and sub-IDs.

// Repeat Pattern
//
// The repeat pattern data type should be used where it is necessary to define the frequency at which an event is to take place.
// This data type provides a way to define repeat pattern codes "on the fly". The repeat pattern code is equivalent to the TQ
// data type, component 2, sub-component 1 (repeat pattern). The additional components define the meaning of the repeat
// pattern code. Components 2 - 10 are used to define relatively simple repeat patterns. Component 11 is provided to define
// complex repeat patterns. This data type forms a bridge between the 2.x Repeat Pattern concept from Quantity/Timing, and
// the Version 3.0 GTS General Timing Specification. Component 1 is the 2.x concept of repeat pattern. Components 2-7 are
// derived from the version 3.0 data type PIVL. Components 8-10 are derived from the version 3.0 EIVL data type. If a repeat
// pattern cannot be defined using components 2-10, then component 11, General Timing Specification is provided. This allows
// the full literal form of the version 3.0 GTS to be specified.
//
// When using the RPT, if an application doesn't recognize the code in component 1, then it may attempt to determine the appropriate
// frequency using the remaining components. If the application does recognize the code in component 1, the application
// is not required to determine the frequency from the remaining components.
// Use Case: The use case supporting this proposal is the need to define repeat patterns on the fly while placing an order. The
// TQ data type did not have the capability to define the meaning of a repeat pattern on the fly. To get around this problem, vendors
// have implemented a variety of solutions to solve this issue. One way was to add Z-components to the TQ data type to transmit
// information about the repeat pattern. Another solution was to attempt to parse the repeat pattern code in an attempt to
// decipher what the code meant.
//
// Examples:
// |Q1H&Every 1 Hour&HL7xxx^^^^1^h|
// |Q2J2&Every second Tuesday&HL7xxx^DW^2^^2^wk|
// |BID&Twice a day at institution specified times&HL7xxx^^^^12^h^Y|

// Text Data

// in Section 2.7, "Use of escape sequences in text fields". Leading spaces should be included. Trailing spaces should be
// removed.
//
// Example:
// |  leading spaces are allowed.|
//
// Since TX data is intended for display purposes, the repeat delimiter, when used with a TX data field, implies a series of
// repeating lines to be displayed on a printer or terminal. Therefore, the repeat delimiters are regarded as paragraph terminators
// or hard carriage returns (e.g., they would display as though a CR/LF were inserted in the text (DOS type system) or as though
// a LF were inserted into the text (UNIX style system)).
//
// A receiving system would word wrap the text between repeat delimiters in order to fit it into an arbitrarily sized display
// window but start any line beginning with a repeat delimiter on a new line.
//
// To include alternative character sets, use the appropriate escape sequence. See Chapter 2, section 2.14.9.18, "MSH-18

// This specification applies no limit to the length of the TX data type, either here where the data type is defined, or elsewhere
