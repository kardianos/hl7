{"id":"CNE","type":"DataType","name":"Coded With No Exceptions","description":"Specifies a coded element and its associated detail. The CNE data type is used when a required or mandatory coded field is needed. The specified HL7 table or imported or externally defined coding system must be used and may not be extended with local values. Text may not replace the code. A CNE field must have an HL7 defined or external table associated with it.  A CNE field may be context sensitive such that a choice of explicit coding systems might be designated. This allows for realm and other types of specificity. Every effort will be made to enumerate the valid coding system(s) to be specified in the 3rd component, however, the standards body realizes that this is impossible to fully enumerate.\r\n\r\nNote:\tThe presence of two sets of equivalent codes in this data type is semantically different from a repetition of a CNE-type field. With repetition, several distinct codes (with distinct meanings) may be transmitted.\r\n\r\nExample 1: The drug must be coded and must be taken from the specified coding system. The coding system is an external coding system.

The coding system, then, to be unique, is a concatenation of the name of the coding authority organization and the name of its code set or table.

Best practice would recommend that this component always be populated. However, if the field narrative explicitly states \"Refer to HL7 Table nnnn for valid values”, and, if the sending and receiving systems are HL7 compliant, the coding system would be known from the standard.
