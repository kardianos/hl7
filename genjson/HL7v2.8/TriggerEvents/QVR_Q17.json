{"id":"QVR_Q17","msgStructId":"QVR_Q17","eventDesc":"Query for previous events","description":"The Query for Previous Events is like a Query by Parameter with a Segment Pattern Response except that the response consists of zero to many messages of the type defined in the Query Profile rather than a single response message containing multiple iterations of the segment pattern.  While the messages sent in response to a QVR will reflect events which occurred in the past, the time stamp in the message header will reflect the time the message is actually constructed (current time).  It is also similar to the previous generation VQQ/RQQ Event Replay. \r\n\r\nWhile the response is similar to subscription messages, it differs from subscription in that the response messages are the result of \"interrogating\" the database rather than events being triggered in the current timeframe.\r\n\r\nIn a Query for Previous Events, the Server still has to parse the query, but avoids the handshaking protocols required in normal query/response situations. The Server acknowledges the query with the general acknowledgement message ACK. The Server then transmits a sequence of messages as if they were simulated unsolicited messages. This is useful for low end systems that unable to deal with the overhead of the query response message syntax, i.e., systems that can only process unsolicited update messages.\r\n\r\nSystems that choose to offer the QVR should offer guidance in the Query Profile, where appropriate, concerning the scope and size of the data requested by the Client.  Moreover, the Query Profile should contain language cautioning Clients of the potential for harm from getting messages out of the original sequence and/or context.  \r\n\r\nUse cases for this query are as follows: 1) to populate a database initially, 2) to recover from an extended down time on the part of the recipient, or 3) to enable systems which normally receive unsolicited data to be extended to act as a query client with minimal modification","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_05"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"QPD","name":"QPD","longName":"Query Parameter Definition","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"QBP","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"Hxx","name":"Hxx","longName":"Any Hl7 Segment","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"RCP","name":"RCP","longName":"Response Control Parameter","sequence":"6","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DSC","name":"DSC","longName":"Continuation Pointer","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
