{"id":"ADT_A39","msgStructId":"ADT_A39","eventDesc":"Merge person - patient id","description":"Event A39 is being retained for backward compatibility.  A merge has been done at the external identifier level.  That is, two PID-2-patient ID identifiers have been merged into one.\r\n\r\nAn A39 event is used to signal a merge of records for a person that was incorrectly filed under two different PID-2-patient IDs.  The “incorrect source patient ID” identified in the MRG segment (MRG-4-prior patient ID) is to be merged with the required “correct target patient ID” identified in the PID segment (PID-2patient ID).  The “incorrect source patient ID” would then logically never be referenced in future transactions.  It is noted that some systems may still physically keep this “incorrect identifier” for audit trail purposes or other reasons associated with database index implementation requirements.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message header segment","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","name":"EVN","longName":"Event type segment","sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient identification segment","sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MRG","name":"MRG","longName":"Merge patient information segment-","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient visit segment","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}
