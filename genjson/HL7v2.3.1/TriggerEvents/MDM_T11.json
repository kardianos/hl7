{"id":"MDM_T11","msgStructId":"MDM_T11","eventDesc":"Document cancel notification","description":"This is a notification of a cancellation of a document.   This trigger event should be used only for an original document with an availability status of “Unavailable.”  When a document has been made available for patient care, the process should be to replace the original document, which then becomes obsolete.  The replacement document describes why the erroneous information exists.\r\n\r\nScenario:  When the author dictated a document, the wrong patient identification was given, and the document was transcribed and sent to the wrong patient’s record.  When the error is discovered, a cancellation notice is sent to remove the document from general access in the wrong patient’s record. In these cases, a reason should be supplied in the cancellation message.  To protect patient privacy, the correct patient’s identifying information should not be placed on the erroneous document that is retained in the wrong patient’s record for historical reference.  A new document notification and content will be created using a T02 (original document notification and content) event and sent for association with the correct patient’s record.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_09"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message header segment","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","name":"EVN","longName":"Event type segment","sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient identification segment","sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient visit segment","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"TXA","name":"TXA","longName":"Document notification segment","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
