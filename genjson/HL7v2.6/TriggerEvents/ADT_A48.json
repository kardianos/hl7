A change has been done at the alternate patient identifier level.  That is, a PID-4 - Alternate Patient ID-PID has been found to be incorrect and has been changed.\r\n\r\nAn A48 event is used to signal a change of an incorrectly assigned alternate patient identifier value.  The \"incorrect source alternate patient ID\" value is stored in the MRG segment (MRG-2 - Prior Alternate Patient ID) and is to be changed to the \"correct target alternate patient ID\" value stored in the PID segment (PID-4 - Alternate Patient ID-PID).","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","name":"EVN","longName":"Event Type","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MRG","name":"MRG","longName":"Merge Patient Information","sequence":"7","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
