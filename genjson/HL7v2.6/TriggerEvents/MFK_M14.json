{"id":"MFK_M14","msgStructId":"MFK_M14","eventDesc":"Site Defined Master File Application Acknowledgment","description":"The MFN Site defined master file notification transaction is used where the master file is not a simple one (as defined for MFN^M13) and is not a transaction type currently defined by HL7, but rather requires one or more HL7 and/or 'Z' segments to carry the master file information.\r\n\r\nThe master file record identified by the MFE segment is contained in Z-segments immediately following the MFE segment, and is denoted by \"...\" in the MFN abstract message definition given above.  This record may be either a flat record contained in a single segment, or a complex record needing more than a single segment to carry its data and (usually hierarchical) structure.\r\n\r\nThe definition of this transaction and the associated abstract message structure code (as defined in MSH-9 - Message Type, denoted by MFN_Znn above) are subject to site negotiation.  Refer to Chapter 2, section 2.17, \"Local Extension\" for additional information on 'Z' abstract message structure code definition.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_08"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MSA","name":"MSA","longName":"Message Acknowledgment","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ERR","name":"ERR","longName":"Error","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MFI","name":"MFI","longName":"Master File Identification","sequence":"6","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MFA","name":"MFA","longName":"Master File Acknowledgment","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
