{"id":"ADT_A48","msgStructId":"ADT_A48","eventDesc":"Change alternate patient id","description":"An A48 event is used to signal a change of an incorrectly assigned alternate patient identifier value.  The \"incorrect source alternate patient ID\" value is stored in the MRG segment (MRG-2 - prior alternate patient ID) and is to be changed to the \"correct target alternate patient ID\" value stored in the PID segment (PID-4 - alternate patient ID-PID).\r\n\r\nEvent A48 has been retained for backward compatibility only, corresponding with PID-4 - alternate Patient ID-PID, which is also retained for backward compatibility.  From V2.3.1 onwards, event A47 (change patient identifier list) should be used instead.  A change has been done at the alternate patient identifier level.  That is, a PID-4 - alternate patient ID-PID has been found to be incorrect and has been changed.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","name":"EVN","longName":"Event Type","sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient identification","sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MRG","name":"MRG","longName":"Merge patient information","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
