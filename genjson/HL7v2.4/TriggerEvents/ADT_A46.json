The \"incorrect source patient ID\" value is stored in the MRG segment (MRG-4 - prior patient ID) and is to be changed to the \"correct target patient ID\" value stored in the PID segment (PID-2 - patient ID).\r\n\r\nEvent A46 has been retained for backward compatibility only, corresponding with PID-2 - patient ID, which is also retained for backward compatibility. From V2.3.1 onwards, event A47 (change patient identifier list) should be used instead. A change has been done at the patient identifier level.  That is, a PID-2 - patient ID has been found to be incorrect and has been changed.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","name":"EVN","longName":"Event Type","sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient identification","sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MRG","name":"MRG","longName":"Merge patient information","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
