For continuous or periodic services, the point at which the service is actually stopped is determined by the components ORC-7^5-end date/time and ORC-7^3-duration, whichever indicates an earlier stopping time.  Ordinarily, only one of these components would be present, but if one requested an EKG with the specification  ^1^QAM^X3^D10 then the EKG would be done for only three days since the number of repeats (3) defined the earlier stopping time.","comment":null},{"value":"S","description":"Synchronous. Do the next specification after this one (unless otherwise constrained by the following components: ORC-7^4-start date/time and ORC-7^5-end date/time). An “S” specification implies that the second timing sequence follows the first, e.g., when an order is written to measure blood pressure Q15 minutes for the 1st hour, then every 2 hours for the next day.","comment":null}]}
