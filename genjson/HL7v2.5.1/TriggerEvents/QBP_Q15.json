{"id":"QBP_Q15","msgStructId":"QBP_Q15","eventDesc":"Query by Parameter Requesting an RDY Display Response","description":"The QBP_Q15 structure supports a Display Response and contains the MSH, QPD, RCP, and DSC segments.  Its default trigger event is Q15.  A standard or site-defined query may use this trigger event or may specify a unique trigger event value in its Query Profile.  If a unique trigger event value is chosen for a site-defined query, that value must begin with Z.\r\n\r\nNote on QBP: Query By Example variant:  The query by example is an extension of Query By Parameter (QBP) in which search parameters are passed by sending them in the segment which naturally carries them. A Conformance Statement which uses this variant must replace the ellipses in the input QBP_Q11 grammar above, with the specific segments that it accepts.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_05"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"QPD","name":"QPD","longName":"Query Parameter Definition","sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"RCP","name":"RCP","longName":"Response Control Parameter","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DSC","name":"DSC","longName":"Continuation Pointer","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
