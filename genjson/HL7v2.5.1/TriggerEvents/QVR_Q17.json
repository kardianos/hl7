{"id":"QVR_Q17","msgStructId":"QVR_Q17","eventDesc":"Query for Previous Events","description":"The Query for Previous Events is like a Query by Parameter with a Segment Pattern Response except that the response consists of zero to many messages of the type defined in the Query Profile rather than a single response message containing multiple iterations of the segment pattern.  While the messages sent in response to a QVR will reflect events which occurred in the past, the time stamp in the message header will reflect the time the message is actually constructed (current time).  It is also similar to the previous generation VQQ/RQQ Event Replay. \r\n\r\nNote on QBP: Query By Example variant:  The query by example is an extension of Query By Parameter (QBP) in which search parameters are passed by sending them in the segment which naturally carries them. A Conformance Statement which uses this variant must replace the ellipses in the input QBP_Q11 grammar above, with the specific segments that it accepts.
