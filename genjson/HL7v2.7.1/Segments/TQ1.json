{"id":"TQ1","segmentId":"TQ1","longName":"Timing/quantity","description":"The TQ1 segment is used to specify the complex timing of events and actions such as those that occur in order management and scheduling systems. This segment determines the quantity, frequency, priority and timing of a service. By allowing the segment to repeat, it is possible to have service requests that vary the quantity, frequency and priority of a service request over time.\r\n\r\nUse cases showing when TQ1 may need to repeat:\r\na) Cardiac enzymes STAT and then q 4 hours.\r\nb) Streptokinase studies, draw 1st Stat and run Stat, then draw q 4 hours and run Stat.\r\nc) Gentamicin 100mg Now and 80mg q12h second dose (First 80mg dose) given exactly 12 hours after the 100mg dose. (Might be 2 service requests.)\r\nActivase 15mg bolus Stat then 50mg over 30 minutes, then 35mg over the next 60 minutes. (Might be 2 service requests.)\r\ne) Imodium 4mg (2 caps) po initially, then 2mg (1cap) after each unformed stool to a maximum of 16 mg per day. (Might be 2 service requests.)\r\nf) Zithromax 500mg (2tabs) po on the first day then 250mg (1tab) po qd for 5 days. (Might be 2 service requests.)\r\ng) Zyban (Bupropion) Start 150mg po qam x 3 days, then increase to 150mg po bid for 7 to 12 weeks.\r\nh) Colchicine 1mg (2 tabs) po now then 1 tablet q1 to 2 hours until pain relief or undesirable side effects (Diarrhea, GI upset). (Might be 2 service requests.)\r\ni) doxycylcine 100mg po bid on the first day then 100mg po qd.\r\nj) scopolamine, xxx mg, 1 hour before surgery. Relative time = -1^hour, priority = P (preop), or alternately repeat pattern = P1H^Preop, 1 Hour before Surgery^99LocalCode, Relative time would be empty and priority would be P (preop).","sample":"","chapters":["CH_04"],"fields":[{"id":"TQ1.1","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.1","length":4,"dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence Id","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Set Id - Tq1","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.2","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.2","length":0,"dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity With Units","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Quantity","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.3","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.3","length":0,"dataType":"RPT","dataTypeName":"Repeat Pattern","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Repeat Pattern","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.4","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.4","length":0,"dataType":"TM","dataTypeName":"Time","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Explicit Time","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.5","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.5","length":0,"dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity With Units","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Relative Time And Units","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.6","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.6","length":0,"dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity With Units","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Service Duration","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.7","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.7","length":0,"dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/time","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Start Date/Time","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.8","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.8","length":0,"dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/time","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"End Date/Time","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.9","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.9","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":"0485","tableName":"Extended Priority Codes","name":"Priority","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.10","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.10","length":0,"dataType":"TX","dataTypeName":"Text Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Condition Text","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.11","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.11","length":0,"dataType":"TX","dataTypeName":"Text Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Text Instruction","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.12","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.12","length":1,"dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":"0472","tableName":"TQ Conjunction ID","name":"Conjunction","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.13","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.13","length":0,"dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity With Units","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Occurrence Duration","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.14","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.14","length":0,"dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Total Occurrences","description":null}]}
