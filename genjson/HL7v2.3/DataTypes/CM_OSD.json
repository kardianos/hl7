However, to support a fully encoded version of order sequencing, or results condition, we have defined in the following paragraphs a 10th component of ORC-7quantity/timing.\r\n\r\nThe sequencing conditions supported by this 10th component are based on the completion of a  predecessor service.","dataType":null,"dataTypeName":null,"length":0,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"tableId":null,"tableName":null,"sample":"","fields":[{"id":"CM_OSD.1","type":"DataTypeComponent","position":"CM_OSD.1","length":0,"dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded values for HL7 tables","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"OSD1","tableName":"Sequence condition","name":"Sequence/results Flag","description":"S for sequence conditions; C for cyclical; R is reserved for possible future use.
